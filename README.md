dataset/: This directory is where you store images of the hand gestures. Each gesture should have its own subdirectory, and inside each subdirectory, you can place the images for that gesture. It's essential to have a diverse and representative dataset for training your model.

models/: This is where you can save the trained neural network model. After training, you can save the model as a .h5 file.

src/: This directory contains your source code. Here's what each Python script does:

capture_gestures.py: This script captures images from the webcam while you perform different gestures. You can save these images to the dataset/ directory in the corresponding gesture subfolders.

train_model.py: This script is used to train your gesture recognition model. It reads the images from the dataset/ directory, preprocesses them, trains a neural network, and saves the model to the models/ directory.

gesture_recognition.py: This script uses the trained model to recognize gestures in real-time from the webcam feed. When a gesture is recognized, it sends a signal to the Arduino.

arduino/: If you're using an Arduino for controlling a device, this is where you store the Arduino sketch (.ino) for that device. This sketch will receive signals from the Python script and control your Arduino-based hardware accordingly

links for datasets/: This directory contains links to external datasets that could be used for training if you don't want to capture your own dataset. Some public datasets for hand gestures and sign language that may be useful are listed here.
